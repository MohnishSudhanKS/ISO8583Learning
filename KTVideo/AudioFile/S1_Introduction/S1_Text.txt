Hi everyone!Thank you all for being here today. I’m excited to have the chance to talk to you about something that plays a critical role in how our financial systems function:ISO 8583.Whether you've used a credit card, withdrawn cash from an ATM, or made a mobile payment, you've likely interacted with ISO 8583 in some form, even if you weren't aware of it. This standard defines how data is transmitted between financial institutions, payment processors, and other entities involved in electronic transactions. It's the unsung hero behind many of the systems we rely on every day for secure, seamless payments.In this session, we’ll dive into the key elements of ISO 8583: its message structure, how it works, and why it’s so important for maintaining consistency and security across global payment systems. I’ll also cover how it’s evolved over time and why it remains essential in the fast-paced world of digital finance.By the end of this session.Now, let's turn our attention to the role of Performance Testing (PT) in relation to ISO 8583. Performance Testing plays a vital role in ensuring that systems built around ISO 8583 can handle the high volume and complexity of real-time transaction processing. When payment systems undergo performance testing, we evaluate how efficiently they process ISO 8583 messages under varying loads and conditions. This ensures that payment systems can scale, perform reliably, and maintain accuracy and security, even during peak transaction periods. The specifics of how PT interacts with ISO 8583 and how performance testing ensures that payment systems remain robust and efficient will be discussed later in this session.
