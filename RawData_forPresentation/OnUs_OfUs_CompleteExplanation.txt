### Explanation:

#### On-Us Transaction Flow:
1. The customer initiates a transaction at an ATM owned by Bank A.
2. The transaction data is sent directly to Bank A.
3. Bank A processes the transaction internally.
4. Bank A sends an authorization response directly back to the ATM machine.
5. If the transaction is approved, the ATM machine dispenses cash to the customer.

#### Off-Us Transaction Flow:
1. The customer initiates a transaction at an ATM owned by Bank B.
2. The transaction data is sent from the ATM machine to a switch.
3. The switch routes the transaction data to the Visa/Mastercard network.
4. The Visa/Mastercard network forwards the transaction data to the issuing bank (Bank A).
5. Bank A authenticates the transaction and sends an authorization response back.
6. The authorization response is transmitted back through the network to the ATM machine.
7. If the transaction is approved, the ATM machine dispenses cash to the customer.

These diagrams detail the flow of transaction data and authorization responses in both on-us and off-us transactions involving a Visa or Mastercard card, including the involvement of switches, payment gateways, Visa/Mastercard networks, and both the issuing and acquiring banks.
