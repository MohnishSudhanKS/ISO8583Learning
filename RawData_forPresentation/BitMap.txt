6. **Intermediaries:**
   - Intermediaries may exist between the Sender and Recipient to facilitate message routing and processing.
   - These intermediaries can include payment processors, switches, and networks that handle message transmission.

**Key Points:**
- Participants in an ISO message include the Sender, Acquirer, Issuer, Recipient, and Intermediaries.
- Each participant plays a specific role in the transmission, processing, and authorization of electronic financial transactions.
- Understanding the roles of participants is essential for efficient message routing and transaction processing.
