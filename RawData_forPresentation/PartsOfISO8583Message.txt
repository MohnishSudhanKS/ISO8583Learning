An ISO 8583 message consists of several parts, each serving a specific purpose in facilitating electronic financial transactions. Here are the main components or parts of an ISO 8583 message:

### 1. Message Type Indicator (MTI):
- The Message Type Indicator (MTI) is a four-digit numeric code that identifies the overall purpose and format of the message.
- The MTI provides information such as the type of transaction (e.g., authorization request, financial request, reversal), message class (e.g., authorization, financial), and message function (e.g., request, response).

### 2. Bitmaps:
- Bitmaps are used to indicate the presence or absence of data elements within the message.
- Primary Bitmap: Represents the first 64 data elements.
- Secondary Bitmap: Used when more than 64 data elements are present in the message.
- Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a specific data element, with a set bit indicating the presence of the corresponding data element.

### 3. Data Elements:
- Data elements carry specific information related to the transaction, such as account numbers, transaction amounts, dates, and additional data.
- Data elements are organized in a fixed format and identified by numeric identifiers ranging from 2 to 128.
- Examples of common data elements include the Primary Account Number (PAN), Processing Code, Amount, and Terminal Identification.

### 4. Header:
- The Header contains additional information about the message, such as network identifiers, source and destination information, and routing details.
- The Header may vary depending on the specific implementation and requirements of the ISO 8583 messaging system.

### 5. Trailer:
- The Trailer marks the end of the message and may contain additional control information or checksums for message integrity verification.
- The Trailer ensures that the message is complete and has not been altered during transmission.

### 6. Subfields:
- Some data elements within the message may consist of subfields, which further break down the information into smaller units.
- Subfields are typically delimited by specific characters or lengths to differentiate individual components within a data element.

### 7. Delimiters:
- Delimiters are special characters used to separate or delineate different parts of the message, such as data elements, subfields, or fields.
- Delimiters help parsers and processors identify and extract specific components of the message accurately.

Understanding the various parts of an ISO 8583 message is essential for developing, processing, and interpreting electronic financial transactions accurately and efficiently. Each component plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity, security, and interoperability of the messaging system within the financial industry.
